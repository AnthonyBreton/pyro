# Python Robotics

A object-based toolbox for robot dynamic simulation, analysis, control and planning. 

## Installation ##

### Dependencies ####
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

### Recommended environment ###
Anaconda distribution + spyder IDE available here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Note: If graphical animations are note working, try changing the graphics backend. In spyder this option is found in the menu at python/Preferences/IPython console/Backend. Inline does not allow animations, it is best to use Automatic of OS X (for Mac).
